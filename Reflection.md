# Reflection – Git Assignment

During this assignment, I learned how Git works as a distributed version control system and how it helps track changes efficiently. I also understood the difference between Git and GitHub, and how GitHub allows collaboration using branches and pull requests.

One of the challenges I faced was dealing with merge conflicts. At first, understanding the conflict markers was difficult, but after practicing on two branches and resolving the conflict manually, the process became much clearer.

The main Git actions and commands I used in this assignment include:
- Initializing a repository
- Creating and switching branches
- Adding and committing changes
- Pushing changes to GitHub
- Creating pull requests
- Merging branches
- Resolving merge conflicts manually in a file

This assignment helped me understand the full workflow of Git and GitHub in real software development.
